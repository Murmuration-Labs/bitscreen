### DISCLAIMERS; NO WARRANTIES

The Websites and Services are made available to you on an "As is" and "As available" basis, with the express understanding that ML has no obligation to monitor, control, or vet the content or data appearing on the Websites and Services or flowing through them. As such, your use of the Websites and Services is at your own discretion and risk. ML makes no claims or promises about the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the websites and online services and expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

### LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

We don’t exclude or limit our liability to you where it would be illegal to do so; this includes any liability for the gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct of ML or any other Party in providing the Services. In countries where the following types of exclusions aren’t allowed, we’re responsible to you only for losses and damages that are a reasonably foreseeable result of our failure to use reasonable care and skill or our breach of our contract with you. This paragraph doesn’t affect consumer rights that can’t be waived or limited by any contract or agreement.

In countries where exclusions or limitations of liability are allowed, ML won’t be liable for:

(a) Any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive, or special damages, or any loss of use, data or profits, under any legal theory, even if ML has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

(b) Other than for the types of liability we can’t limit by law (as described in this section), we limit the total liability of ML for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of the form of the action, to the greater of $50.00 USD or the amount paid by you to ML to use our Services.

### DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING ARBITRATION

We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against ML, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim by email at support [@] murmuration.ai or by certified mail addressed to Murmuration Labs LLC, 655 Tennessee Street, Unit 103, San Francisco, CA 94107. The notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be sent to the email address included in the notice and will contain the information described above. If we can’t resolve matters within thirty (30) days after any notice is sent (subject to mutual extensions agreed to in writing by the parties), either party may initiate a formal proceeding.

Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with ML and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.

(a) No Representative Actions. You and ML agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and ML and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.

(b) Arbitration of Disputes. Except for small claims disputes in which you or ML seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county where you reside or disputes in which you or ML seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property, you and ML waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California unless you’re a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence. For purposes of this section a “consumer” means a person using the Services for personal, family or household purposes. You and ML agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS website and are incorporated into these Terms by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

(c) You and ML agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

(d) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, ML, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality doesn’t apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

(e) You and ML agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and ML will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by ML, ML will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and ML agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.

(f) Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and ML will not have the right to assert the claim.

(g) You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this section by sending an email of your request to support [@] murmuration.ai. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the next section regarding “Governing Law and Venue.

(h) If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable.


### GOVERNING LAW & VENUE

These Terms and any dispute that arises between you and ML will be governed by California law except for its conflict of law principles. Any dispute between the parties that’s not subject to arbitration or can’t be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in San Francisco, California. Some countries have laws requiring agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer’s country. This paragraph does not purport to override such laws.

### CHANGES TO THESE TERMS

ML reserves the right to make modifications to these Terms at any time. Revised versions of these Terms will be posted to this Website or a third-party service such as GitHub. Unless otherwise specified, any modifications to the Terms will take effect the day they are posted to this Website. If you do not agree with the revised Terms, your sole and exclusive remedy will be to discontinue your use of the Websites and Services.

### GENERAL

These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and ML regarding your use of and access to the Websites and Services. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions. Use of the word “including” will be interpreted to mean “including without limitation.”  You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor will a waiver of any breach or default of these Terms or any provision of these Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. In the event that any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. You acknowledge that the Websites and Services are not intended to be technology protection measures that will help you comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) or Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA).

You agree that communications and transactions between us may be conducted electronically.
